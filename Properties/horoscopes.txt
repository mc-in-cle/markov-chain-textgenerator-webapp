You've got the whole world in your hands this month. Seriously, there is nothing that can stop you from achieving your dreams and getting your desires met. Let's begin with Uranus. The great agent of change will shift back into your sign on November 6 after having briefly transitioned into Taurus on May 15. From now through March 6, 2019, you'll experience the final journey of personal awakening that can make you feel more alive than you've ever felt before. It's time to claim your Aries birthright to courageously be the pioneer who dares to do what no one has done before. What will this be for you? It will certainly affect your love life. In fact, Venus turns direct right in your partnership sector on November 16 and will oppose Uranus in your sign by November 30. This is a major personal awakening -- or a wake-up call -- about your relationship. A dramatic and unexpected fresh start between you and your mate is possible. If you have been waiting for that special someone to make a commitment to you in some way â¦ well â¦ your wait is probably over. Besides Uranus re-entering Aries this month, an equally dramatic and exhilarating cosmic shift involves lucky Jupiter. The planet of blessings, abundance, spirituality, and divine protection will enter her home sign of Sagittarius -- a very auspicious transition for you. Now that Jupiter is in a compatible Fire sign, you'll find it easy to maximize the blessings he wants to throw your way. He'll be in your 9th House of Expansion until December 2, 2019, and you might choose to go back to school and expand your intellectual horizons during this time. You might also get a major travel bug and consider international vacations or even a study abroad program. This will also be a spectacular year to publish a book or spread your wisdom in a way that can reach many people. Your voice is inspiring, and your message can instill faith and hope to others in a glorious way. As an added bonus, you might receive an amazing lucky break from a spiritual mentor or from someone who has a background quite different from your own. If you happen to find yourself involved in any legal drama this year, don't stress. You are protected. It will truly be a month for you to think bigger than you ever have before. Jupiter in your 9th house wants you to take a magic carpet ride to a whole new world. It's waiting for you. After all the back and forth emotional turbulence you endured last month related to your partnership, you'll feel as if you've finally struck gold this month. A New Moon in your relationship sector on November 7 will have you and your partner easily healing and moving on to calmer waters. Venus was retrograde in this area of your chart last month and as a result, you had some serious second thoughts about the direction of your love life. You might have experienced a traumatic restimulation of past betrayal, or you might have just fallen into a dark pit of hopelessness, expecting the worst from love and never considering that you and your lover might be meant to rise from the ashes together. This month, you'll see that together is exactly where you want to be -- and you'll both be willing to put forth the effort. Adding to this goodness is the fact that Uranus will dip out of your sign and back into Aries on November 6, giving you back much of the solid footing you felt you had lost since mid-May. Life has certainly picked up speed and become exciting, with many rapid changes. But you are tired, Taurus, and you need time now to adjust to all that life-altering chaos. So this November you will settle down â¦ and so will your love life. Even more stability is coming your way after November 16 when Venus, your ruler, finally turns direct. She'll be in your work and health sector at this time, helping you to monetize freelance assignments and to collaborate harmoniously with colleagues. If you're thinking about getting any cosmetic procedure, you've got the green light once Venus is direct in this part of your chart. You'll be pleased with the results! There's even more of a gold rush happening in your world this month, and it is literally about material abundance. Jupiter, the planet of expansion, will move into your 8th House of Shared Resources on November 8 where he'll remain through December 2, 2019. This is the part of your chart connected to money you get through any other source besides your own direct paycheck. That's a money tree with many, many branches! This month you'll begin to see a major opportunity connected to making money passively. Making money while you sleep is certainly up your alley! You might also earn extra cash through investments, royalties, bonus or commission checks, a financial settlement, or even an inheritance. Getting a loan or mortgage will be easy breezy with Jupiter in this area of your chart. Also, if you're looking for an investor to help fund a business idea, you might have your pick of the litter. These people will also truly believe in your professional skills, making it even more valuable for you to work together. Lastly, if you're married, this part of your chart rules your partner's income. He or she might see a major increase in their wealth quotient which, of course, will benefit you. This month everything will turn around in your love life. Yes, it's going to be THAT dramatic. It all begins with Jupiter, the planet of expansion and abundance, moving into your partnership sector for the first time in 12 years! This happens on November 8, and Jupiter will remain here until December 2, 2019, blessing you and your partner in ways that might seem too good to be true at times -- but it's not. It's real. If you're in a committed partnership and things are going well when this transit begins, you can anticipate the joy factor in your relationship to expand beyond anything either of you ever envisioned. If, however, you go into this time with a very troubled relationship, it's possible that you and your mate will call it quits. This could be a time when you hire attorneys or decide on mediation. The bright side of this if it's your scenario is that any break-up during a Jupiter cycle is likely to be amicable and not as stressful as it could be. Count your blessings! Even so, be wary of miscommunication between you and your partner or you and your legal representation from November 16-December 6 while Mercury is retrograde. Now, if you are single and open for love or if you're dating someone new, there is a much more romantic storyline. For starters, Venus will turn direct in your true love sector on November 16. A recent reconciliation with an ex might turn into the love you always wanted with this person. Or, a new person might enter the picture. If so, you can be certain that this is a karmic love connection. Happily, it looks like good karma! With Jupiter in your partnership sector as well, there is every indication that over the next year you'll find yourself in a fairy tale romance with someone you quickly become committed to. Marriage is even on the table. And that Full Moon on November 23 in your sign will have you feeling all the feels. Do you have butterflies in your stomach yet? Oh, don't worry. You will. This month is so chaotically beautiful. You're not going to know where to focus on first. As early as November 6 you'll notice a jumpstart professionally. Uranus dips back into the area of your chart connected to your professional world, essentially turning it upside down once more (and until March 6, 2019). But don't worry -- this time it's a happy surprise. That's because Jupiter moves into your work sector two days later, bringing in abundance and plenty of lucky breaks to this area of your life. You might suddenly quit a job that makes you miserable only to find your dream job the very next day. Or, you might have a sudden opportunity to seize a promotion or expand a freelance business. With Jupiter in your 6th House of Well-Being until December 2, 2019, you'll also find yourself well protected in health. If there is anything you need to take care of over the next year, you can smile knowing you'll have top notch healthcare. You might also feel more optimistic about your health than you have in quite a while, because you're finally taking care of matters you've been neglecting for far too long. Your love life will get a boost as well thanks to a gorgeous New Moon in your romance sector on November 7. Karmic love connections are still a major theme after November 16 when Venus finally turns direct. She'll move forward in your home and family sector, suggesting that one of your relatives might introduce you to your next soulmate. You might also meet this person at a family gathering, so keep your eyes peeled! 
 If you've been going through money like water when it comes to work around your house or on family expenses, it will all begin to regulate itself after November 16. Mercury retrogrades on the same day as Venus turning direct, adding yet another layer of flavor to this month's cosmic soup. Happening in your work sector, it's possible that you and a colleague will begin to experience some misunderstandings. Fortunately, with Jupiter in the same area of your chart, you'll work through it. You might also go back to a job you held in the past. It'll be even better this time around. You'll actually feel as though your opinions are respected and you don't have to speak as loudly in order to truly be heard. Are you smiling yet? You most definitely should be, especially once you find out exactly what cosmic goodness is in store for you starting this month and lasting for an entire year! Jupiter, the planet of gifts and luck, will move into your romance sector on November 8 where he'll remain until December 2, 2019. This is a monumental shift and hasn't happened for nearly 12 years. If you're single going into this transit, there is every chance that you won't be by the time it's over. In fact, you might even have more than one joyous love affair. You see, your heart is now open -- really open -- to receiving the magical blessing of love. Because you are optimistic about your love life and potential, the universe is ready to respond in a major way. This isn't just any old ordinary love that's about to rock your world, Leo. No, this is big love. BIG. Jupiter does nothing small, so what else could it be? Although you might not meet this person in November, the stars are absolutely aligning, so get ready. It's coming! If you're already in a relationship, it's possible you and your love will be ready to make a baby. Fertility is high for you over the next year, so if a child is not on your agenda just yet, then you might want to take the proper precautions. Alternatively, it is possible that what you'll give birth to is a creative endeavor that sparks you. You'll have so much fun with this project. In fact, it has a great chance of succeeding because of the passion you'll put into it. A New Moon lands in your home and family sector on November 7, suggesting a fresh start in domestic matters. You might begin the process of moving or starting a home renovation. Whatever changes are happening in your domestic world, you can be sure that they will be deeply transformational, while also having the potential to bring great healing to your family unit. That is definitely positive news! Venus, the planet of love, money, and harmony, has been retrograde since October 5. Since October 31, she has been hiding out in your communication sector. However, on November 16, she'll turn direct, allowing you to mend fences with a sibling you might have been on the outs with for the last couple of months. You might also be ready to move forward with a significant financial or romantic decision. Interestingly enough, Mercury will turn retrograde in your 5th House of True Love on the same day. Yes, Jupiter is there expanding all those 5th house goodies, but you might find yourself mentally stuck in the past now that Mercury is retrograde. You might be thinking a lot about an ex-lover or even find yourself communicating with them again. If you're single, you might consider giving this relationship another whirl. Don't commit one way or the other. The universe wants to give you abundance in this area. You won't know until next month if the ex is the right path or if this retrograde just brought him or her back for closure. Domestic bliss is about to be yours! Jupiter, the planet of "happy and jolly," will move into your 4th House of Home, Family, and Real Estate on November 8. He'll remain in this part of your chart until December 2, 2019, so this is absolutely a cosmic shift you'll want to celebrate. Have you and your clan been experiencing any problems? Help is here! Jupiter will act as a protective buffer and mediator, somehow smoothing over rough edges in your family relationships so that everything gets better. Another benefit to having Jupiter here is that it will be one of the best possible times for you to move, renovate, or otherwise change your living situation. Even if it's not more living space, you'll experience it as a definite upsize. The happiness quotient of your living situation will improve -- and that's priceless! Your family might also expand under this influence, so don't be surprised if you find out that someone in your clan is expecting. In other news, Venus will turn direct on November 16, allowing you to move forward with a major financial decision. This might be about you launching a new product or service if you're in business for yourself. Another possibility is that you'll finally have the confidence to market one of your talents that you used to feel like you needed to keep under wraps. Revealing this gift to the world will not only make you feel amazing, but you'll soon realize that it has been a branch on your personal money tree all along. You're definitely moving on up in career matters as well this month. A Full Moon at the top of your chart on November 23 will leave you in the spotlight. All eyes are on you and guess what everyone is seeing? Success. Mercury, your ruler, will turn retrograde on November 16 and will remain so until December 6, mainly in your 4th house. This might not be such a bad thing this time around. You might actually reconnect with family members you've been out of touch with for a while. In fact, a reunion now will be healing, especially with Jupiter hanging around the same part of your chart. Wow! This is a fascinating month astrologically on many fronts. For you, the most pivotal turning point will occur on November 16 when Venus, your ruler, turns direct in your sign. Venus has been out of phase since October 5 but has been napping in Libra since October 31. This time period for you has likely been quite significant. Not only has it brought up a host of insecurities for you to navigate, but there might have been a great deal of uncertainty regarding a romantic relationship or a financial situation. You'll see major developments in both of these areas in November, that's for sure. However, the most radical change will happen on the inside. With Venus being retrograde in your sign, you have been forced to look yourself in the mirror and see what's really staring back at you. Is it a person with confidence, joy, exuberance, and amazing talent and love to offer the world, or is it the polar opposite? Most likely, you fall somewhere in the middle. The holes that have opened up in your self-worth profile need to be repaired. Knowing your worth will translate into stronger, happier relationships with others and a more successful relationship with money as well. In fact, a significant shift in your partnership is likely with Uranus edging back into your 7th House of Commitment on November 6. This change was long overdue, and you might not have felt confident enough to negotiate it before. Now you do! A New Moon in your earned income sector follows on November 7. See? You are going to make a profound change internally that absolutely will lead to an opportunity to get your money right more than ever before. Jupiter, the planet of blessings, will enter your communication sector on November 8. Suddenly, you are craving more knowledge. You'll also feel inspired to share your wisdom with others. Remember, knowing your worth is the greatest knowing of all. As you step into November, you might feel like the universe has pressed a cosmic reset button in your life. A New Moon in your sign on November 7 promises a clean slate and a fresh start -- wherever you choose to direct it. There is something about your personal journey and development that you might be ready to initiate after a long phase of contemplation. With this lunation, you'll feel like you've got the power to stop thinking and start doing. In terms of your personal life, you might be ready to stop keeping secrets between you and your sweetheart. If you have been sitting and stewing over something over these last couple of months, you'll notice that you'll feel less swept away in the undertow of emotion over this situation by November 16. Even if an honest conversation might lead to tears being shed, you know that is needs to happen. Fortunately, once Venus turns direct in your 12th House of Secrets, you will no longer be a prisoner of what you've been keeping to yourself. If this recent Venus Retrograde had nothing to do with your love life, it's likely that you've been carefully reviewing your financial situation. A talent that you used to feel insecure about monetizing and sharing with others might have become something for you to reconsider. You might have spent time overcoming any anxiety connected to this and are now ready to turn this into something. Fortunately, you have amazing cosmic support when it comes to money matters. Jupiter, the planet of expansion and blessings, will move into your earned income sector on November 8 where he'll remain through December 2, 2019. With Jupiter in this part of your chart, you'll notice an exponential increase in your ability to create wealth. Not only will you make more money, but the confidence you have in yourself to do so will be at an all-time high. There is a direct relationship between you believing that you can and you actually doing it. That is the beauty of Jupiter. You do seem to spend time recalibrating your financial plans once more after November 16 thanks to Mercury Retrograde. What you will notice here is that you're no longer suffering from any insecurity about your talents. At the same time, you might have lacked a strategy for implementing them in the past. Now you'll spend time making this right. It'll pay off more than you think. In fact, you might see this for yourself as early as November 23.There is so much for you to celebrate this month!

From November 8 through December 2, 2019, you will have nothing but open road ahead to be, do, and have anything you want in life. This is not an exaggeration.

If you have ever read "The Secret" and tried to tap into the law of attraction and abundance, you have been handed a cosmic magic wand to make it all happen. It's not about merely believing that your dreams can come true -- it's knowing with all your heart and soul that they're true and you're already living them. Once you make that internal shift, you'll start to notice the universe conspiring in your favor to truly make miracles happen in your life.
