How dare you say that my behaviour's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered "Goodbye", she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore...

You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true

You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus:]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe 'em anyway

So come to bed It's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Repeat chorus x3]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles and wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah.

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain.
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[In the background:]
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show
My face 'round here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

Would you ever turn your head and look
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

Mmmm, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah!

You better turn your head a look
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh!

And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

Yeah (tangled!)
Ohhhh, mmmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ooh
(And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up)

After school walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass

And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me

Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles—."
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus:]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

This is not goodbye she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

When I was
Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]

There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through

[Chorus x2]

I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

May not know

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow

Oh, yeah, yeah...

There is a flower in your hair.
I'm a flower in your hair.

Oh, yeah, yeah, oh

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go Oh No

[Chorus:]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh No they can't

I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are

Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus x2]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh 'cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

I ain't ever coming back to you

When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door pick up the phone
You wont find me cause I'm not coming home

You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[x2]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown

I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[x3]
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home

Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say


How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel

Feel...
Feel...
Feel...

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel ...

Yeah another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And I say I'm on my way now
Yeah I say I'm on my way now

Show up when it's lights out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

Ya tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

Parties with shots and powder
But, you rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
Till I woke up a thousand years later
Realizing I'm the same
As I was before I saw your face

Ya tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm not just the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm not just the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
Oh-oh baby
I just want the best for you

Ya tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

But I'm not the best for you (for you)
You don't want
What I'm gonna put ya through

Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no

Not invited but I'm glad I made it

Keep me connected, to you
Like I was your shadow
You're givin' me answers
To all of my questions
Here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

Just turn off the lights
And you could be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners
The neighbors must think we're crazy, baby
Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you

It's not time for conversation, no
I don't want to complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

All of my love, all of my love
My time my attention
My patience I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No this ain't the way
That I usually play this
No, no

Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you
Would I lose
If I bet my heart on you
I don't wanna slow down
Won't you let me know now
Would I lose, oh
If I bet my heart on you (bet my heart on)

Is it real, is it fake
Would you leave, would you stay
Will the night turn into day
Will we get closer or will it be over
I'm only hoping
I don't waste, I don't waste

All of my love, all of my love
My time my attention
My patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No this ain't the way

Won't you let me know now

If I bet my heart on you

I'm getting kind of over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you awake as me?
If not, do you wanna be?

Ooh I need some temporary saving
Ooh I need some, some uncomplicating

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out
'Cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

I don't mean to bother you
But there's something that I want from you
Distract me from thinking too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch

Ooh I need some temporary saving
Ooh I need some, some uncomplicating

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out
'Cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

When you, you need somebody to
Hey hey, I know that there will come a day when
When you, you need somebody to
Help you out
Help me out
Help me out
Help me out, out

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out
'Cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

And hey hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Hey hey, I know that there will come a day when
When you, you need somebody to
Help you out
Help me out
Help me out
Help me out, out

See this one goes out to all the lovers
Lovers, lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days undercovers
Girls the sun could burn out
But you'll still shine
Yeah

No, don't ask me if I love you
Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
Cause I'm sure that the time will come

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Oh-oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No I do oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No don't ask me if I love you
Cause I'm sure
As the day is gone
And don't ask me if I stay true
When you know you're the only one

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Oh-oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No I do oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

Ya
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you
Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes
And I see the ocean
I ain't got no wings
But you got me floating on
Could looking down it's emotion
Champagne flutes, everybody toasting
Heartbeat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down spin you and round
Can you hear me now?

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Oh, oh
Hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Oh-oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay

No I do oh-oh ay
Oh-oh-oh ay
Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

I never knew that love was blind
'Till I was hers
But she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn
I let it burn, yeah
The feeling, it was bittersweet
Realizing I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn
I had to learn, yeah

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin' I
Would've sold my soul
For a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off my heart

Leaves are fallin'
It's September (Woah)
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (So Young)
'Till she kissed me (Yeah)
Like a whiskey (Yeah)
And I was so young (So Young)
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey

Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through

Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too

Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you thinking it's better if you drive

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through

You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you want to do this face to face
Bottle opens we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here you would stay

If you want closure

I tried to resist but I just can't

Oh as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again

If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
If you want closure
